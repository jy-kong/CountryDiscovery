# CountryDiscovery

Country Discovery is a Shiny application that helps the user to look through different aspects of countries.
There are altogether 19 features of 97 different countries.

Analyses are provided with visualization of various kind of plots in data exploration!
Let's explore it!

p.s.: Save the World Map.png image in a folder named "www" in the same directory as .R script if you want to run the code and download the files.
